**Project Proposal: Scrap Pickup Management System**

**1. Project Description:**
We propose the development of a Scrap Pickup Management System, aimed at streamlining the process of scrap collection and management. This system will facilitate both individual and enterprise customers in scheduling and managing scrap pickups efficiently.

**2. Features to be Added:**

**1. Login/SignUp Sign-in:**
Implement a secure authentication system to allow users to sign up or log in to the platform, ensuring data security and user privacy.

**2. OAuth Functionality for Smooth Onboarding:**
Incorporate OAuth functionality to provide a seamless onboarding experience for users, allowing them to sign up or log in using their existing social media or email accounts.

**3. User Input Form:**
Design a user-friendly form where users can input essential details such as their name, location, frequency of scrap pickup, and also which scrap they want us to pick - like lead batteries, plastic or PET bottles etc, and whether they are an individual or an enterprise. Additionally, include an option for users to select a membership period, offering them better quotes as an incentive for commitment.

Once the user submit the form, in its screen it should be visible **schedule pickup data and time.**

**4. Admin Panel:**
Develop an intuitive Admin Panel that provides administrators with insights into user registrations and data analysis capabilities. The Admin Panel should include the following features:

**User Registration Overview:** Display the total number of registered users, categorized by individual and enterprise customers.

**Data Filtering:** Implement filters based on the frequency of scrap pickups, geo-location, and user category (individual or enterprise). Allow administrators to filter data based on a combination of these parameters.

**Visual Representation:** Utilize visual representations such as pie charts, line charts, or any suitable graphical format to present data analysis results. Visual representations enhance data comprehension and provide a more appealing user experience.

**3. Edge Cases to be Considered:**

**3.1. Incomplete Scrap Pickup Notification:**
If our scrap pickup personnel are unable to complete the required number of customer visits within a day due to unforeseen circumstances, it is imperative that the system promptly notifies affected customers regarding the situation. The system should provide a mechanism for the pickup personnel to communicate reason for their inability to complete the task and specify the rescheduled pickup date.

For instance, if a representative is assigned to visit 25 locations for scrap pickup but can only manage to complete 18, the system should facilitate notifying the remaining 7 customers about the delay. This notification should include an explanation for the delay and specify the rescheduled pickup date.

**For example,** if the representative conducts pickups on August 24, 2024, for locations scheduled every 3 days, then the system should reschedule pickups for the remaining 7 locations on August 25, 2024, and August 27, 2024. This ensures synchronization of the pickup cycle for all 25 locations after Aug 27. 




**3. Conclusion:**
The Scrap Pickup Management System aims to revolutionize the way scrap collection and management are handled, offering a user-friendly platform for both individuals and enterprises. By incorporating features such as secure authentication, seamless onboarding, and intuitive data analysis tools, this system will enhance operational efficiency and user satisfaction. We look forward to your approval and the opportunity to commence development on this innovative project.
