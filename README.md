**Project Proposal: Scrap Pickup Management System**

**1. Project Description:**
We propose the development of a Scrap Pickup Management System, aimed at streamlining the process of scrap collection and management. This system will facilitate both individual and enterprise customers in scheduling and managing scrap pickups efficiently.

**2. Features to be Added:**

**1. Login/SignUp Sign-in:**
Implement a secure authentication system to allow users to sign up or log in to the platform, ensuring data security and user privacy.

**2. OAuth Functionality for Smooth Onboarding:**
Incorporate OAuth functionality to provide a seamless onboarding experience for users, allowing them to sign up or log in using their existing social media or email accounts.

**3. User Input Form:**
Design a user-friendly form where users can input essential details such as their name, location, frequency of scrap pickup, and also which scrap they want us to pick - like lead batteries, plastic or PET bottles etc, and whether they are an individual or an enterprise. Additionally, include an option for users to select a membership period, offering them better quotes as an incentive for commitment.

Once the user submit the form, in its screen it should be visible **schedule pickup data and time.**

**4. Admin Panel:**
Develop an intuitive Admin Panel that provides administrators with insights into user registrations and data analysis capabilities. The Admin Panel should include the following features:

**User Registration Overview:** Display the total number of registered users, categorized by individual and enterprise customers.

**Data Filtering:** Implement filters based on the frequency of scrap pickups, geo-location, and user category (individual or enterprise). Allow administrators to filter data based on a combination of these parameters.

**Visual Representation:** Utilize visual representations such as pie charts, line charts, or any suitable graphical format to present data analysis results. Visual representations enhance data comprehension and provide a more appealing user experience.

**3. Edge Cases to be Considered:**

**3.1. Incomplete Scrap Pickup Notification:**
If our scrap pickup personnel are unable to complete the required number of customer visits within a day due to unforeseen circumstances, it is imperative that the system promptly notifies affected customers regarding the situation. The system should provide a mechanism for the pickup personnel to communicate reason for their inability to complete the task and specify the rescheduled pickup date.

For instance, if a representative is assigned to visit 25 locations for scrap pickup but can only manage to complete 18, the system should facilitate notifying the remaining 7 customers about the delay. This notification should include an explanation for the delay and specify the rescheduled pickup date.

**For example,** if the representative conducts pickups on August 24, 2024, for locations scheduled every 3 days, then the system should reschedule pickups for the remaining 7 locations on August 25, 2024, and August 27, 2024. This ensures synchronization of the pickup cycle for all 25 locations after Aug 27. 

**3.2 User Cancellation Policy:**

In the scenario where a user cancels a scheduled scrap pickup due to reasons such as unavailability or holidays, it is essential to provide a structured process for rescheduling while ensuring operational efficiency.

**Rescheduling Procedure:**
Upon user cancellation, the system will allow the user to choose an alternative pickup date immediately after the original scheduled date (which means tomorrow). However, users are limited to altering the pickup date a maximum of two times per month.

**Exhaustion of Rescheduling Opportunities:**
If a user exhausts their two rescheduling chances within a month, the system will restrict further modifications, and the user will be required to notify us about their unavailability for the scheduled pickup. In such cases, the system will automatically reschedule the pickup for the next available slot. For instance, if a pickup was scheduled for August 21, 2024, and the user has exhausted their rescheduling opportunities, the user will only need to notify us about their unavailability, and the next pickup will be scheduled for August 24, 2024 (if its frequency is 3 days).

**Utilization of Rescheduling Opportunities:**
On the other hand, if the user has rescheduling chances available, the scrap pickup personnel will accommodate the user's preferred rescheduled date (which means only tomorrow). For example, if the user cancels the pickup scheduled for August 21, 2024, and still has rescheduling chances remaining, the scrap picker will arrange pickups for August 22, 2024, followed by August 24, 2024.

This policy ensures a balance between user flexibility and operational efficiency while maintaining a structured approach to managing rescheduling requests.

**3.3. Spamming by Wrong Address:**
In the unfortunate event of a user attempting to spam the system by providing incorrect pickup locations through multiple accounts, it is imperative to implement measures to detect and mitigate such fraudulent activities.

**Solutions:**

**1. Address Verification:** Implement a robust address verification system to ensure the accuracy of provided pickup locations. This could involve cross-referencing user-provided addresses with verified databases or employing geolocation services to confirm the validity of addresses.
**2. User Authentication:** Strengthen user authentication processes to discourage the creation of multiple accounts for fraudulent purposes. Employ techniques such as email verification, phone number verification, or identity verification to authenticate users and deter spamming.
**3. Suspicious Activity Monitoring:** Utilize algorithms and machine learning techniques to detect patterns indicative of spamming behavior, such as repeated submission of incorrect addresses from multiple accounts. Implement alerts and monitoring mechanisms to flag suspicious activities for further investigation and intervention by administrators.
**4. Feedback Mechanism:** Incorporate a feedback mechanism where users can report suspicious or incorrect addresses. Admins can then review and verify reported addresses to ensure data accuracy and integrity.

**3.4. Selling sub par quality product:** No technical solution can be effective here. One company specialized person needs to accompany to do quality check. 

**3. Conclusion:**
The Scrap Pickup Management System aims to revolutionize the way scrap collection and management are handled, offering a user-friendly platform for both individuals and enterprises. By incorporating features such as secure authentication, seamless onboarding, and intuitive data analysis tools, this system will enhance operational efficiency and user satisfaction. We look forward to your approval and the opportunity to commence development on this innovative project.
